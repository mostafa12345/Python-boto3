# Python-boto3

A collection of Python-based tools for AWS cloud automation and resource management.

## Introduction

 This repository for Python scripts designed to streamline AWS cloud operation, this project aims to provide modular, reusable tools for tasks like resource inventory, automation, and monitoring. Our first tool fetches VPC and EC2 details in AWS `us-east-1`, saving them as JSON files. More tools will be added to tackle various cloud challenges.

Whether you're a cloud engineer, DevOps professional, or enthusiast, this repo offers practical solutions for AWS management.
